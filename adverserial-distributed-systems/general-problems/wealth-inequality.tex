\section{Wealth Inequality and the Gini Coefficient}

Many popular blockchains follow a Proof-of-Stake model of consensus. In PoS, the more tokens you have staked, the more faith you present to the network. In return, the network rewards you with more tokens for protocol validation services you provide to the network. 

This mainly means that a certain actor with more tokens can stake more tokens, and assuming does follow protocol right, earn more tokens as a result. This is a positive feedback loop, and is often referred to as the "rich get richer" problem. This is a problem because it leads to wealth inequality in the network.
