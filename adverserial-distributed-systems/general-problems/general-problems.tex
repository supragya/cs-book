\section{The ever growing state, state expiry}
State expiry refers to removing state from individual nodes if it hasn't been accessed recently. There are several ways this could be implemented, including:

\textbf{Expire by rent}: charging "rent" to accounts and expiring them when their rent reaches zero. This design is implemented in Solana.
\textbf{Expire by time}: making accounts inactive if there are no reading/writing to that account for some amount of time
