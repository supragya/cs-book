\section{State Machine Replication}

Let's motivate the \textbf{State Machine Replication} \index{State Machine Replication} problem by imagining a distributed system that needs to maintain a consistent state (state as in, in finite / infinite automata) across all nodes. One may want to do this simply to improve uptime. If the state is replicated across different nodes, then if one node goes down, the system can still function.
