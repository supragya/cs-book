\section{Most important subproblems}
Most of the times while we find ourselves looking at different problem statements, many-a-times at their core, they stem from one of the following few recursive relations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{O/1 Knapsack}:
    \item \textbf{Unbounded Knapsack}:
    \item \textbf{Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)}:
    \item \textbf{Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)}:
\end{itemize}
